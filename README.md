# Revature - Project 0

## Executive Summary

The goal of the Paired Programming Project is to create a basic 
user/item management application. The type of items managed is 
completely up to you. (Collectible items? Animals? Books? Video 
Games?). The app shall include two database tables with a PK/FK 
relationship between them. For example, users and books. 
Imagine that this app is for **admins** managing the users 
and the items, not for the actual users themselves.

## User Stories (what can this app do?)

Users of the application can:

- Select all items from the items table

- Select one item by its ID

- Select all items that belong to a certain user (find by user id FK)

  - This may be tricky, look at GameDAO for a hint.

- Insert a new item into the items table

- Insert a new user into the users table

- Update a user

- Delete an item

- [Some other functionality of your choice]
